# Clothing-Suggeter
As a developer you couldn't find enough time to pick what to wear everyday,
so create a personal clothing helper app to make your life easier.
Clothing Suggester App should check the weather in your city for you using any API you like (we provide some).
then you should already enter a set of images of the clothes that you own into the drwable section in the app. 
The app should help to wear a suitable clothes for the weather this day,
like some shirts for sunny warm day and jacket or coats for cold days.
To Avoid wearing the same clothes two days in row, use shared preferences to know what you wear the latest days,
so you can go with easy algorthim by divide the clothes into groups suit different temperature ranges,
then it will pick randomly some clothes suitable for today weather with ignoring what you used previous days.
Following the above requiremnt will help you to create basic app, we don't limit our talents, 
if you have more time you can improve and make the app smarter and you can also avoid enforce group of images into drawable,
instead you can make the user pick from gallery!. For Technical requiremnts, use OKHttp library for network part,
don't use any Jetpack library, and avoid using model generator in this task.
